## land elevation changes from 2013-2020
My site is published at https://holland-surveying.github.io/Paducah/

In this are of Paducah we see a lot of change of the elevation of the land between the years 2013 and 2020. In the top righ portion of the map frame we see a large amount of both cutting and filling of the land throughout th years. It looks as if this area has been nearly redeveloped since the data started in 2013. We also see large removal of possibly large trees in the bottom right of the mapframe.
